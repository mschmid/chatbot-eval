"""Fixtures and constants for the Module 3 evaluation tests.

The three test files in this directory check different parts of the application:

  - test_unit.py:        deterministic checks that guard YOUR CODE. No LLM,
                         no database. Run on every commit.
  - test_integration.py: one bounded piece of a trajectory, the rest mocked
                         (FakeModel drives the real Runner). No API call.
                         Run on every push.
  - test_e2e.py:         the real agent on evaluation cases, k runs each,
                         checked against the CI rule. Costs money and samples, so
                         it runs on pull requests and nightly, and it skips
                         locally unless an API key is present.
