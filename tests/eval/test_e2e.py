"""Complete agent tests on evaluation cases, with k runs for each case.

Each evaluation case runs EVAL_K times, each run in a freshly re-seeded world
(the sandbox reset), scored by the case's code checks plus its pinned
Module 2 judges. The per-case pass count feeds the CI rule you
implemented in tests/eval/passk.py:

  - a regression case blocks on ANY failed run (its baseline is k of k);
  - a capability case never blocks CI, but its pass rate is reported in the
    log and exported as a Module 5 improvement target.

The CI decision never uses pass@k. Passing a case because one run in k
succeeded would allow a broken behavior to merge.

The complete agent tests use model calls, so they run on pull
requests and nightly (see .github/workflows/evals.yml), not on every
commit. A local run requires CARTWHEEL_RUN_E2E=1 and an API key. Reruns are
for infrastructure failures only; a verdict flip is data and lands in the
per-case pass rate.
